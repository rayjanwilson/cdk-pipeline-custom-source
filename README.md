# CDK Pipeline Custom Source Action

With CDK you can choose a few things to be `Source` action for your pipeline, from GitHub, BitBucket, CodeCommit, to even ECR. What you currently are not able to do out of the box is use any old git provider. This project aims to address that and is a remix of the excellent work done by [kbild.ch custom codepipeline source](https://kbild.ch/blog/2020-11-11-custom_codepipeline_source/).
